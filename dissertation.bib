abstract="We show how error-correcting, deterministic, combinator parsers can be constructed for grammars which have the LL(1) property. The normal disadvantages of conventional combinator parsers, such as their lack of speed and their poor error reporting, are remedied. Parsers constructed with these combinators are implicitly specialised for the grammar they describe. Because of this property the combinators act as a parser generator for LL(1) grammars. The techniques used to construct the combinators illustrate how partial parametrisation and careful ordering of computations can be used to achieve implicit partial evaluation in a lazy language.",

		  principles of probability theory. Starting from the basics
		  of probability, the authors develop the theory of
		  statistical inference using techniques, definitions, and
		  concepts that are statistical and are natural extensions
		  and consequences of previous concepts. Intended for
		  first-year graduate students, this book can be used for
		  students majoring in statistics who have a solid
		  mathematics background. It can also be used in a way that
		  stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
		  being more concerned with understanding basic statistical
		  concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for
		  a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal
		  optimality investigations.}},

abstract = {On the race toward exascale supercomputing systems are facing important challenges which limit the efficiency of the system. Among all, power and energy consumption fueled by the end of Dennard's scaling start to show their impact on limiting supercomputers peak performance and cost effectiveness.In this paper we present and describe a new methodology based on a set of HW and SW extensions for fine-grain monitoring of power and aggregation of them for fast analysis and visualization. We propose a turn-key system which uses MQTT communication layer, NoSQL database, fine grain monitoring and in future AI technology to measure and control power and performance. This methodology is shown as an integrated feature of the D.A.V.I.D.E. supercomputing machine.},

abstract = "Machine learning (ML) is continuously unleashing its power in a wide range of applications. It has been pushed to the forefront in recent years partly owing to the advent of big data. ML algorithms have never been better promised while challenged by big data. Big data enables ML algorithms to uncover more fine-grained patterns and make more timely and accurate predictions than ever before; on the other hand, it presents major challenges to ML such as model scalability and distributed computing. In this paper, we introduce a framework of ML on big data (MLBiD) to guide the discussion of its opportunities and challenges. The framework is centered on ML which follows the phases of preprocessing, learning, and evaluation. In addition, the framework is also comprised of four other components, namely big data, user, domain, and system. The phases of ML and the components of MLBiD provide directions for identification of associated opportunities and challenges and open up future work in many unexplored or under explored research areas."

abstract = { Probabilistic programs are usual functional or imperative programs with two added constructs: (1) the ability to draw values at random from distributions, and (2) the ability to condition values of variables in a program via observations. Models from diverse application areas such as computer vision, coding theory, cryptographic protocols, biology and reliability analysis can be written as probabilistic programs.  Probabilistic inference is the problem of computing an explicit representation of the probability distribution implicitly specified by a probabilistic program. Depending on the application, the desired output from inference may vary---we may want to estimate the expected value of some function f with respect to the distribution, or the mode of the distribution, or simply a set of samples drawn from the distribution.  In this paper, we describe connections this research area called ``Probabilistic Programming" has with programming languages and software engineering, and this includes language design, and the static and dynamic analysis of programs. We survey current state of the art and speculate on promising directions for future research. },

abstract = {We study a simple inductive data type for representing correct-by-construction matrices. Despite its simplicity, it can be used to implement matrix-manipulation algorithms efficiently and safely, performing in some cases faster than existing alternatives even though the algorithms are written in a direct and purely functional style. A rich collection of laws makes it possible to derive and optimise these algorithms using equational reasoning, avoiding the notorious off-by-one indexing errors when fiddling with matrix dimensions. We demonstrate the usefulness of the data type on several examples, and highlight connections to related topics in category theory.},
